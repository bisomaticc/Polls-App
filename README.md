# Poll-App

The Poll App is a comprehensive and robust polling application that offers a wide range of features. To fully utilize its functionality, users are required to register in order to access and participate in polls. Once a user has voted on a poll, they are prevented from casting another vote. The exclusive privilege of managing a poll, including adding, editing, updating, deleting, and ending a poll, is granted only to the poll's owner. If a poll is marked as ended, it becomes non-voteable, and users can only view the final result of the poll.
